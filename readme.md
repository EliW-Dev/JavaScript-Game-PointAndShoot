# JavaScript Click to Shoot Game

A simple point and click game built in JavaScript.

## Description

built with HTML, CSS and vanilla js.

Enemies will spawn from the right of the screen, if they make it to the left of the screen the player loses a "life".

Click/Tap on an enemy to destroy it and earn a point.

The difficulty will ramp reasonably (ish) quickly, with enemy spawn rate and move speed increasing over time.

There is no winning here, just survive as long as you can!
